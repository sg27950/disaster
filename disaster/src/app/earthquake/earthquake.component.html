          <ul>
            <li>If in a vehicle, pull over and stop.</li>
            <li>If in bed, stay there.</li>
            <li>If outdoors, stay outdoors.</li>
            <li>Do not get in a doorway.</li>
            <li>Do not run outside.</li>

        <div class="col-5">
          <ul style="vertical-align: text-top">
            <li>Secure items, such as televisions, and objects that hang on walls. Store heavy and breakable objects on
              low
              shelves.</li>
            <li>Practice <strong>Drop, Cover, then Hold On</strong> with family and coworkers. Drop to your hands and
              knees.
              Cover your head and neck with your arms. Crawl only as far as needed to reach cover from falling
              materials.
              Hold on to any sturdy furniture until the shaking stops.</li>
            <li>Create a family emergency communications plan that has an out-of-state contact. Plan where to meet if
              you
              get
              separated.</li>
            <li>Make a supply kit that includes enough food and water for at least three days, a flashlight, a fire
              extinguisher, and a whistle. Consider each person’s specific needs, including medication. Do not forget
              the
              needs of pets. Have extra batteries and charging devices for phones and other critical equipment.</li>
            <li>Consider obtaining an earthquake insurance policy. Standard homeowner’s insurance does not cover
              earthquake
              damage.</li>
            <li>Consider a retrofit of your building to correct structural issues that make it vulnerable to collapse
              during an
              earthquake.</li>

        <div class="col">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Drop, Cover, then Hold On</strong> like you practiced. Drop to your hands and knees. Cover your
              head and neck with your arms. Hold on to any sturdy furniture until the shaking stops. Crawl only if you
              can reach better cover without going through an area with more debris.</li>
            <li>If in bed, stay there and cover your head and neck with a pillow.</li>
            <li>If inside, stay there until the shaking stops. DO NOT run outside.</li>
            <li>If in a vehicle, stop in a clear area that is away from buildings, trees, overpasses, underpasses, or
              utility wires.</li>
            <li>If you are in a high-rise building, expect fire alarms and sprinklers to go off. Do not use elevators.</li>
            <li>If near slopes, cliffs, or mountains, be alert for falling rocks and landslides.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Expect aftershocks to follow the largest shock of an earthquake.</li>
          <li>Check yourself for injury and provide assistance to others if you have training.</li>
          <li>If in a damaged building, go outside and quickly move away from the building.</li>
          <li>Do not enter damaged buildings.</li>
          <li>If you are trapped, cover your mouth. Send a text, bang on a pipe or wall, or use a whistle instead of
            shouting
            so that rescuers can locate you.</li>
          <li>If you are in an area that may experience tsunamis, go inland or to higher ground immediately after the
            shaking
            stops.</li>
          <li>Save phone calls for emergencies.</li>
          <li>>Once safe, monitor local news reports via battery operated radio, TV, social media, and cell phone text
            alerts for emergency information and instructions.</li>
          <li>Use extreme caution during post-disaster clean-up of buildings and around debris. Do not attempt to
            remove
            heavy debris by yourself. Wear protective clothing, including a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, work
            gloves, and sturdy, thick-soled shoes during clean-up.</li>
